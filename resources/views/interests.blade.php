                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time inside. Doesn't mean I'm an caveman, just a programmer. In the weekends I like to spend time with friends. During school weeks I like to spend my time playing games or watching movies. I also go to the gym twice a week, got to train the body as much as the mind!</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">At other times, I really enjoy cooking. I always like an enjoyable meal after a hard days work. I also like to continue developing my programming skills and learn new things</p>
